## Installation Requirements

* _.NET SDK_
* _C# editor_
* _Terminal or Command Prompt_

## Setup

2. Open your terminal (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) and navigate to this project's production directory called "VendorOrderTracker".
3. Run `dotnet watch run` in the command line to start the project in development mode with a watcher.

## Known Bugs

*  _Users can input prices with multiple decimal places (e.g., 10.000000) instead of restricting the input to two decimal places (e.g., 10.00). This issue may affect the accuracy of order pricing and should be addressed in future updates to enhance the application's usability and data consistency._
